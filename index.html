  <h1>LHC Rock Hunt Puzzle</h1>
  <p>After Lysoling the Living Hope Church rock, I went about my business in the apartment only to turn around andâ€”aliens! Somehow, several aliens transported themselves into my living room. They grabed the rock and tossed a puzzle on my table, along with several envelopes. "The puzzle shows where we hide the rock. The envelopes have hints," they said, "but do not open the hints before the time written on each, or we will come back and kill you." They disappeared as suddenly as they appeared.</p>
  <p>I don't really know why these aliens cared about the LHC rock. I'm thinking that most likely they've been orbiting the planet, watching us, and when this pandemic hit they became just as bored of it as we are. They just want entertainment now. Heck, maybe in boredom they created the virus, but now regret that because they're even more bored! In any case, once I get over the trauma of seeing aliens in my house, I'm sure I'll be glad they've decided to join our fun.
  <p>Their guns looked scary so I'm not going to open the hints early. The times written on the envelopes seem to be spaced 36 hours apart. The first hint says "Do not open before 9am Tuesday" so that's when I'll open it and let you know.</p>
  <p>I scanned their puzzle and provided different versions of it below for your convenience. I can't make any sense of it.</p>
  <p><strong>Update:</strong> Ahn-Cheng solved the puzzle and found the rock within 26 hours. I guess the aliens won't kill me for opening all the hints, so there they are.
  <ol>
    <li>These aliens must be bored enough to watch earthling entertainment. This hint just says: "Jodie Foster".</li>
    <li>Now they say: "This is a matching puzzle."</li>
    <li>Ugh, another name: "John Hurt".</li>
    <li>Oh my, these aliens are taunting us. The fourth hint reads: "No need to think outside the box."</li>
    <li>Ok I think this gives it away. A link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SbKE_U4b7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SbKE_U4b7U</a></li>
